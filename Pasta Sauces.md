# Pasta Sauces

## Understanding pasta

All pasta are noodles but not all noodles are pasta. What makes italian noodles (pasta) different is mainly the use of durum wheat flour.

## Understanding the sauces

Most sauces here are essentially an emulsion of a fat & water. The water in most pasta sauces usually comes courtesy of the water which is used for cooking the pasta. The starch in said water helps the emulsification process by acting as a stabiliser.

## Substitutions

### Hard cheese

This is cheese that is aged longer, and thus, has a lower moisture content. They are dry, often crumbly, and tend not to melt well (if attempted they require a higher temperature).

+ **Pecorino Romano**; made by sheep's milk, relatively saltier than other ones.

+ **Parmigiano-Reggiano**; made by cow's milk. Characterised by a sharp, nutty, and savory favour.

+ **Gorgonzola**; made by cow's milk. It can be buttery or firm, crumbly and quite salty, with a "bite" from its blue veining.

### Mushrooms

+ **Porcini Mushrooms**

### Cured meat

Preserved meat by the addition of salt, with the aim of drawing moisture out of the food by the process of osmosis. Many curing processes also involve smoking, spicing, cooking, or the addition of combinations of sugar, nitrate, nitrite.

+ **Guanciale**;

+ **Pancetta**;

+ **Bacon**;
