## Concept

Slow cooking has 2 major goals:
- Set it and forget it methodology
- Make tough things soft

## General Rules

- Pre-season meat well
- Unless building a sauce, avoid using extra liquid other than what the meat already contains
- Cook on high for 4 hours, low 8 hours

## BÅ“uf bourguignon

 - Red wine, to half cover
 - Dried mushrooms
